Containers also have an OS but which is actually just a small part of an OS like about 5percent and all the other part it took from the host OS.
DOCKER IS AN OS LEVEL VIRTUALISATION where as VMVARE IS A HARDWARE LEVEL VIRTUALISATION.

DOCKER is mostly recommended to be used on linux but it can also work on some windows. Docker tool is used to run docker on the windows, this tool have those linux files which are required to run the docker container.

Advantages of DOCKER:
♫No pre-allocation of RAM
♫Continuous Integration Efficiency: Docker enables you to build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process
♫Less cost
♫It is light in weight
♫It can run on physical H/W, Virtual H/W or on cloud
♫We can re-use the image
♫It took very less time to create the container

Disadvantages of Docker:
♫Docker is not good solution for application that requires rich GUI
♫Difficult to manage large amount of containers
♫Docker does not provide cross platform compatibility means if an application is designed to run in a docker container on windows then it can't run on linux or vice-versa
♫Docker is suitable when the development OS and Testing OS are same if the OS is different we should use VM.
IF dev have ubuntu then testing also need to have ubuntu, it won't work with centOS or other OS.

DOCKER CONTAINER does it works in the form of/ it is LAYERED FILE SYSTEM
DOCKER ECOSYSTEM: Set of software packages, It have different components:

1. Docker client:
Docker users can interact with docker deamon through a client
Docker client uses CLI and API to communicate with the docker deamon
It is possible for docker client to communicate with more than one daemon

2.Docker deamon/engine/server: 
It does all the execution of commands like: pull, etc
Runs on host OS
Responsible for running containers to manage docker services
Docker daemon can communicate with more than one deamons

3.Docker hub/registry: Public and Private registry

4.Docker images:
Read only binary templates used to create docker containers
Single file with all dependencies and configuration required to run a program
☺Image can be create from the existing container
☺Image can be taken from docker hub
☺Image can be created with help of a docker file

5.Docker Compose

6.Docker Host: Its the machine(HOST MACHINE) upon which whole docker ecosystem is running.

For ubuntu                            For centos
sudo su                                 sudo su
apt update                             yum update
apt install docker.io -y          yum install docker

╚Docker Image:
#To download docker image go to hub.docker.com
docker pull centos                                                                     #It will downlaod centos image #docker pull centos:7 #To pull version 7 of it

#Tag represents which docker image you have downloaded (like; latest, 9,8 ,7)
#Docker image is a read only set of instructions

╚Docker Container:
#reason behind creating a contianer is so that we can deploy an application upon it
docker run                                                                            #To create a container
docker container run                                                            #another command to create a container
#attach mode : when -d is not mentioned 
docker container run -it --name c1 ubuntu                          #it interactive terminal #name container name of your choice #c1 is the container name of our choice #ubuntu is the image

docker ps -a                                                                    #Another command to show all the containers running as well as stopped
#detach mode : when -d is mentioned
docker container -it --name c2 -d centos                       #If the image is not downloaded it will first download it and then create the container #centos is the image name
docker ps -a
docker start c1                                                              #To start a container

docker exec -it c1 bash                                               #To enter inside container
ls
mkdir test1
ls
docker restart c1                                                        #If container is in start state it will stop and restart it and if a container is in stopped state it will start it

Difference between stop and pause
when a container is running an application and if it is on step three out of five and stopped and started again, It will start from the begining but in the case of pause it will start from where we put a pause on it.
docker pause c1
docker ps
docker unpause c1
docker ps

#To delete the container:
docker stop c1
docker container rm c1                                              #docker rm c1
dcoker rm -f                                                              #To delete a container even in running stage
docker ps -a

#If a docker image is reffered to a container then to remove it first you remove the docker container

docker container run -it --name web -d ngnix
docker top web                                                       #To check how many processes running inside the container
docker stats web                                                    #memory is been used by a container

 # Inspect debug your container
docker inspect                                                      #docker container inspect
